We spent today continuing our discussions from last meeting about strategy and design.

A. Revisited/discussed designs from last meeting
    1. Discussed what parts we liked and disliked about each design.
        a. Liked: through mechanism, rotating component to remove turning around
    2. Debated between two designs
        a. two sets of slides, one horizontal/rotating + one for up and down -- and one set of rotating linear slides
        b. Discussed issues with each -- string tension, motor strength, # of motors available, etc, found less issues with two sets of slides, but technically not settled
