We began our season with our first meeting on September 3, 2024. During this meeting, we cleaned the field, set up a new GitHub organization to track our progress, and joined the new club Google Classroom. In our second meeting on September 5, we created a preliminary season outline in GitHub projects and the software team continued working on preparing for the season. We also started disassembling old mechanisms to repurpose or prototype new ideas.

Throughout the month, we spent several meetings defining our game strategy and brainstorming design ideas. We discussed our ideal game strategy, considering pre-auto, auto, teleop, and endgame. This helped us identify the capabilities our robot would need to have and shaped our vision for the season. We also revisited and refined our design ideas, debating the pros and cons of various options.

We spent September 17 and 19 constructing our new field, verifying the number of parts and following the setup instructions. During this time, Eli worked on fixing Gradle-related errors, ensuring our software was running smoothly.

As the month progressed, we made significant progress on both the hardware and software fronts. We established a consensus on the scoring mechanism design, featuring two linear slide components, and discussed chassis specifics. We modeled the basic chassis in OnShape, confirmed our scoring mechanism design, and took stock of our owned parts, calculating new parts to be ordered. In software, we fixed Gradle-related errors, established a task to create an accurate auto movement framework using odometry, and refactored our codebase.

We experimented with and finalized our chassis design, deciding on a design where linear slides are mounted in the middle. We also prototyped two chassis designs and made measurements for linear slides needed. In software, we tested JUnit unit testing, Eli continued working on his JSON auto framework, and we added comments to our code. Overall, we made considerable progress in defining our strategy, designing our robot, and setting up our tools and field for the season.
