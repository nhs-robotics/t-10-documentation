Hardware
- Vertical slides are done -- had some issues with tension and strength of 3D printed parts (connectors snapped) but they work now
- Rotating slides have been dis and reassembled multiple times due to issues (motor strength, connectors strenght, pulleys snapped) -- now reprinting pulleys with carbon fiber PLA and different orientation so hopefully stronger
- Designing claw
Software
- Removed many constants to opt for robot configuration-specific values which allow us to use the same codebase for different robots which have different constants
- Created AutoBuilder teleop to build auto programs faster
    - allows us to use the controller to create a robot path during auto
    - creates a Java file which contains the generated autonomous programs
- Fixed outreach robot configuration
- Identified Snowball coefficients
    - omni drive
- Fixed linear navigation with odometry
- Added isPressed to GButton and GTrigger in gamepad framework
- Created localizer
    - determines absolute position of the robot on the field
    - uses odometry to track relative position to a known absolute position on the field to return the robot's absolute position
    - optionally uses April Tags to recalibrate whenever an April Tag is in range
- Created robot visualizer
    - Created metrics system
        - allows us to track whatever metrics we want in real time in the interface
        - uses @Metric annotation to a variable, set variables in Java like normal (it's that easy)
    - Created field viewer
        - displays a 3d model of the field with Three.js
        - shows with the robot's position on the 3d field in real time using the localizer
        - integrates with metrics system to add custom points and poses on the field in real time
    - Created camera viewer
        - streams the camera to the web interface in real time
        - can view April Tag annotations in real time
    - Created hardware map viewer
        - shows the entire hardware map and additional information in the interface
