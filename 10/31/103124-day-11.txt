Today was another work day. Project Manager Lincoln has been putting a lot of pressure on hardware to get an MVP for hardware by the end of today's meeting so that software can integrate next week. Kudos to Lilly for working so hard on the claw. Lincoln has also put pressure on Software team to be ready to hit the ground running next week with developments like AutoBuilder intended to make the auto process faster.
