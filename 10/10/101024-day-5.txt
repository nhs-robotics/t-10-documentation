Today, we continued building the test chassis, prototyping intake, and prototyping precise movement code.

A. Hardware
    1. Test chassis construction
        a. Missing some minor parts, will scavenge on Monday and mostly finish by Tuesday
    2. Evan finished Desdin's claw design
    3. Outreach robot/old robot - repairs
        a. The robot has lost set screws and has sustained some age
        b. Note for odometry: make sure back wheel doesn't get stuck on chassis, make sure odometers are facing in correct orientation relative to each other (issue with some software numbers?)
B. Software
    1. Arlan started prototyping precise movement code
    2. Ilan and Liam working on unit testing
