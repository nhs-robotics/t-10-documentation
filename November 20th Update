- Vertical slides are done -- had some issues with tension and strength of 3D printed parts (connectors snapped) but they work now
- Rotating slides have been dis and reassembled multiple times due to issues (motor strength, connectors strenght, pulleys snapped) -- now reprinting pulleys with carbon fiber PLA and different orientation so hopefully stronger
